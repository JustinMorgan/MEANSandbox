# MeanSandbox
This is a playground project to experiment with Node.js and the MEAN stack. I'll be experimenting with implementation,
design patterns, and best practices in various aspects of Node development:
- RESTful API
- Direct parsing of CoffeScript (not compiling to JS first)
- Mongoose best practices
- Unit testing
- Authentication (OAuth)
- Integration with cloud app/DB hosting
- Jade view templates
- SASS and/or LESS
